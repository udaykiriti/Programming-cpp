/*
    Codeforces Problem 9A - Die Roll

    Yakko and Wakko roll a standard 6-sided die and get values Y and W.
    Dot wants to know the probability that she can win by rolling a value
    that is at least as high as the maximum of Y and W. If she ties, she wins.

    The total number of outcomes on a 6-sided die is 6.
    The number of favorable outcomes is (6 - max(Y, W) + 1).
    The output is the simplified probability of winning as a fraction.

    Sample Input:
    4 2

    Sample Output:
    1/2

    Explanation:
    The maximum of 4 and 2 is 4.
    Dot can win by rolling 4, 5, or 6 â€” 3 favorable outcomes out of 6.
    Probability = 3/6 = 1/2.
