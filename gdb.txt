================================================================================
                                    GDB NOTES
================================================================================

1. Compile with debug symbols:
   g++ -g -O0 file.cpp -o a.out

   If you dont want to debug and want to use external debugs:
   g++ -std=c++20 -Wall -Wextra -O2 -DLOCAL name.cpp -o name
   ./name < in.txt > out.txt


2. Start GDB:
   gdb ./a.out
   run           [normal run]
   run < in.txt  [with input file]

3. Breakpoints:
   [At specific line or may be functions names and you can watch vars]
   watch varname       [watch variable when they change]
   break 25            [at specific line marks as Breakpoint]
   break solve         [at particular functions]
   break 42 if x > 100 [at conditions]

   info break  [about Breakpoints]
   delete 2    [delete watch points]
   rwatch name [detect when a variable is read]
   awatch name [detect all access "r" + "w"] 
   disable 1 / enable 1 [disable or enable ]
   watch *ptr  [watch pointer]

4. Execution:
   continue [resumes and go and stops until the next Breakpoint]
   step     [go to piece of line even may be like (Increment of program counter)pc + 1][if function present it go to it]
   next     [Executes && go to piece of line like pc + 1][skips functions]
   finish   [run until current function returns]
   si       [next instruction not code or any line][like Assembler]

5. Print variables:
   print x     [value of variable]
   p x         [short notation of print x]
   p arr[0]@10 [print 10 consecutive elements from arr[0]]
   p vec       [entire array or vector]
   p *ptr      [prints the value stores in that Memory location]
   watch x     [Stops execution when the value of x changes]

6. Backtrace:
   bt       [show the call stack (functions that led to the current point)]
   bt full  [show the call stack with local variables for each frame]
   frame 2  [switch to stack frame #2 to inspect its variables and context.]

7. Jump:
   jump 60 [move execution to that line {skips b/w lines}]

8. Memory:
   x/20xb &arr [examine 20 bytes of memory at &arr in hex {x = hex, b = byte}]
   x/5i $pc    [show the next 5 assembly instructions starting at the current program counter ($pc)]

9. Segfault debugging:
   run [runs the entire program until it crashes]
   bt [after crash, show the call stack to find the exact line that caused the segmentation fault]

10. Search:
   list       [show Src code around the current line]
   list 40    [show Src code around line 40]
   list solve [show the Src code of the fun solve()]

11. TUI mode:
   layout src [open TUI mode showing the source code window]
   layout asm [open TUI mode showing the assembly instructions]
   layout regs [open TUI mode showing CPU registers]

12. Useful settings:
   set pagination off   [disable “—More—” prompts for uninterrupted output]
   set print pretty on  [pretty-print complex structures (STL containers, structs)]
   set logging on       [start logging all GDB output to a file (gdb.txt by default)]

13. Quitting GDB:
   quit        [exit GDB]
   q           [short for quit]
